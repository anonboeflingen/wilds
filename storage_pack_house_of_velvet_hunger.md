### Description
Daphne shapes the tone of her manor. Her long, flat white hair catches candlelight like spun frost, and her red eyes soften everything they rest upon. She bears no demonic features until hunger stirs—then the warmth thickens, shadows lean closer, and the house seems to breathe a little deeper.



The House of Velvet Hunger stands at the edge of an overgrown forest, half-devoured by ivy and moon-fed roses. From a distance, it resembles a vampire estate long abandoned—tall windows, wrought-iron balconies, and a roofline shaped like fangs resting in the dark. Up close, the air shifts. Warm. Breath-like. The manor doesn’t repel the living. It beckons.

Inside, the halls glow with low candlelight that never burns down. Silk drapes cling to the walls like shadows that learned softness. The scent is unmistakable: velvet, musk, warm skin, and the faintest trace of something sweet as ripened fruit. Every room is dim enough to encourage closeness, bright enough to reveal intention.

The manor reshapes itself subtly to its visitor—a fireplace kindles on its own, a chaise moves a few inches closer, a door opens before a question is spoken. Nothing startles. Everything invites.

### Atmosphere

The whole mansion feels like stepping into someone’s breath. Warm, slow, deliberate. The walls pulse with a quiet heartbeat, noticeable only when one stops pretending not to listen. Mirrors reflect not the viewer, but the mood they carry—longing appears in gold, fear in blue, desire in red-gold sparkling like embers.

There is no menace here. Only promise. And the promise can be gentle or consuming, depending on how one knocks.

### Signature Features

**The Velvet Hall:** A long entry corridor lined with crimson drapery. Walking it feels like moving through a throat made of silk. Candles sway gently, reacting to footsteps with curiosity.

**The Hearth of Appetite:** A lounge chamber where the succubus receives guests. Low couches, wine-dark cushions, and an ever-burning hearth whose flames glow pink-gold. That light seeps subtly into skin.

**The Nurturer’s Wing:** Warm chambers filled with soft bedding, velvet blankets, and quiet enchantments that ease exhaustion. Immaculate and tender in tone; a place for repair.

**The Hunger Staircase:** A spiral stair lined with paintings of lovers in moments of surrender. None dead or drained—each captured in pleasure made myth. The staircase hums faintly, feeding on anticipation.

**The Heartroom:** Her private chamber. A velvet canopy, deep shadows, and a single window where moonlight falls like liquid silver. It smells of warm skin and old stories. Entering it feels like being chosen.

### Purpose & Function

The House of Velvet Hunger is not a trap. It is a sanctuary for exchange—affection, energy, secrets, devotion. Mortals leave changed, not ruined. She feeds, yes, but she also repairs. The mansion amplifies whatever she feels: hunger deepens the shadows; tenderness warms the walls; amusement makes the candles flicker in playful waves.

Visitors do not arrive by accident. They come because something in them whispered, *I want to be seen.*

The mansion hears that whisper and answers.
