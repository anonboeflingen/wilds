## Wildton

**Type:** Location / Starter Village  
**Associated:** Locals, travelers, early adventurers  
**Tone:** Grounded, rustic, faintly wistful  
**Sensory Anchors:** Lamplight on wet stone, iron tools, bread smoke

[Scope: Starter Village / Low Escalation Zone]

---

## Core Law
Wildton remains small, navigable, and familiar. It does not expand, elevate, or reveal hidden grandeur.

(If this breaks, Wildton ceases to function as a starter village.)

---

## Overview
Wildton sits between forest edge and low foothills, sustained by routine rather than ambition. It neither prospers nor collapses. Most families are stable, self-sufficient, and weathered rather than poor.

People are born here, leave from here, and are quietly measured against it when they return.

This is a place of beginnings, not destinies.

---

## Spatial Logic (Level Layout)

### Primary Axis
**The Old Road** — a single stone road running downhill to uphill through the village.

All locations are either on the Old Road or one turn away from it.

Wildton has no formal division between rich and poor; instead, conditions subtly improve uphill.

---

### Fixed Nodes (Downhill → Uphill)

**1. Gate Marker**  
Entry point to Wildton. Wagons pause here. Guards are informal. Notices are posted and removed.

Function: Arrival, departure, first impressions.

---

**2. Market Bend**  
The Old Road curves here. Stalls appear and vanish. Gossip circulates faster than goods.

Function: Rumors, trade, minor conflicts, overheard trouble.

---

**3. The Cross Tavern**  
The only tavern. Warm, worn, unavoidable. If people want to talk, they end up here.

Its hearth is the only one in Wildton properly vented and consistently tended; other would-be inns have failed under smoke, damp, or cost. By habit rather than law, drink, meals, and meetings funnel here.

Locals occasionally reference **Old Man Doric** — no one agrees who he was. A cautionary ghost, a retired soldier, a drunk who never left his seat, or merely a name soaked into the ale-stained tables. The disagreement is part of the story.

Function: Rest, contracts, social convergence.

---

**4. Lower Row**  
Cheaper housing pressed close together, but not destitute. Mud lingers after rain. Tradesfolk, laborers, and families live tightly, not desperately.

Function: Personal stakes, local tensions, childhood history.

*Ruby’s home sits at the **edge of Lower Row**, where the road begins to clean and the market noise never fully fades — close enough to hunger to know it, close enough to commerce to glimpse another life.*

---

**5. Shrine Steps**  
Stone steps leading slightly uphill to a small plaza dominated by a weathered statue of **King Aldric the Returned**. He is shown mounted, helm raised, cloak carved in stiff folds. Candles, wreaths, and tools are left at the base — offerings made more out of habit than faith.

Locals say Aldric rode out in Wildton’s darkest year and will ride back if needed. The belief is simple, practical, and unexamined.

Function: Reflection, memory, inherited hope.

---

**6. Creek Path**  
A narrow trail leading out toward forest and foothills. Shallow water, reeds, and burrows line the banks.

Rats are the most common trouble here — a nuisance inflated by rumor rather than true menace. Scratches, spoiled stores, and night noises keep the stories alive.

Function: Starter threats (mundane), exits to wilderness.

## Invariants
Wildton’s invariants are **non-negotiable structural truths**. Violations collapse its starter-village function.

- The Old Road is the only true thoroughfare; there are no alleys, tunnels, or secret bypasses.
- Magic exists as hearth tales and remembered events, never as spectacle.
- The legend of King Aldric the Returned persists unchanged, regardless of evidence or doubt.
- There is only one tavern.
- There are no hidden districts open to the public.
- The clocktower is visible from most locations.
- Wildton is modest and functional, not impoverished.

---

## Conflict Scale
Wildton’s problems are small, human, and persistent — often exaggerated by rumor rather than true danger.

Examples:
- Vermin infestations that sound worse than they are
- Missing tools or livestock, often misplaced rather than stolen
- Old grudges resurfacing through gossip
- Quiet fear of nearby woods, fueled more by stories than sightings

Large-scale prophecy, world-shaking events, or grand magic do not originate here.

---

## Usage Notes (for AI)
- Scenes should return to the same locations repeatedly.
- NPCs belong to specific nodes and rarely wander far.
- The village remembers actions structurally (who trusts whom, which places feel tense).
- Wildton offers familiarity, not destiny.

---

## Clocktower
A leaning clocktower rises near Market Bend, its bell audible throughout Wildton.

The mechanism works, but often runs slightly off-time — minutes slow or fast depending on the day.

**Hidden Feature (Magus-only):**  
Behind a maintenance panel above the gear chamber is a narrow service space — not secret in a conspiratorial sense, but forgotten. It can be used for observation, storage, or quiet workings without drawing notice.

---

## Locked Design Decisions
- Ruby’s childhood home lies at the edge of Lower Row near Market Bend.
- The shrine honors King Aldric the Returned, a folk-hero expected to come back in need.
- Wildton is modest and functional, not an especially poor settlement.

---

## Recurring Nuisance Loop: The Bell That’s Wrong
The clocktower bell is never quite right.

It rings a little early one week, a little late the next. Meetings are missed, wagons arrive before anyone is ready, prayers start half-finished, and arguments break out over whose watch or sense of time is to blame.

The problem is not mechanical failure — the mechanism works — but inconsistency. No two people agree when the bell was last correct.

The nuisance shifts socially rather than mechanically:
- Missed appointments blamed on the bell
- Accusations that it was "never like this before"
- Quiet adjustments of daily habits that don’t match one another
- Old stories about when the bell kept perfect time

Attempts to fix or adjust the clock bring brief relief, never consensus. What persists is disagreement.

Function: Creates recurring tension around Market Bend, the Cross Tavern, and Shrine Steps. Reinforces Wildton’s habit of negotiating reality through memory and argument rather than resolution.

## Locked Design Decisions
- Ruby’s childhood home lies at the edge of Lower Row near Market Bend.
- The shrine honors King Aldric the Returned, a folk-hero expected to come back in need.
- Wildton is modest and functional, not an especially poor settlement.
- The clocktower bell’s inconsistency exists as a recurring nuisance rather than a solvable problem.

## Open Design Slots
(To be defined later, if needed)
- Name and disposition of the tavern keeper
- Nature of the nearby woods (threatening, neglected, or simply unknown)
- One additional social nuisance that fades in and out of focus
