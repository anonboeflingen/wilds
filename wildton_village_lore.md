## What People Say Wildton Is
Wildton is described as "a good place to start," "easy to leave," or "harder to forget than expected." None of these are argued about. They are simply repeated.

People rarely describe the village as poor or rich. They describe it as *known*. Even strangers are quickly placed into categories: passing through, staying a season, or having unfinished business.

## Common Sayings & Habits
- "If you’re late, blame the bell."
- "The road tells you where you are."
- "Things don’t change here — people just remember them differently."

Daily habits are shaped less by rules than by expectation. People arrive early to avoid being late. Others arrive late to avoid waiting. No one agrees which is correct.

## The Clocktower, As Spoken Of
The bell is discussed constantly and investigated rarely.

Some insist it has always been unreliable. Others swear it kept perfect time once. Arguments about *when* that was are longer than the arguments about fixing it.

People adjust their lives around the bell without admitting they do so.

## The Shrine of King Aldric (Local Understanding)
King Aldric is not prayed to in desperation. He is acknowledged.

Offerings are left out of habit: a candle when passing, a wreath on certain days, a tool before a difficult season. No one expects an answer, but no one stops either.

Children are told Aldric will return "when things are bad enough," though no one can agree what that would look like.

## The Cross Tavern, In Practice
The Cross Tavern is where stories settle.

Disagreements that begin elsewhere are brought here to cool. Some never do.

**Old Man Doric** is referenced when conversations stall. Each telling contradicts the last. The inconsistency is part of why the name persists.

---

## Lower Row, Remembered
Lower Row is spoken of with familiarity rather than pity.

Most people know someone who grew up there. Many say it taught them how to listen.

People who leave Wildton remember Lower Row more clearly than anywhere else.

---

## Visitors & Returnees
Visitors are noticed. Returnees are measured.

Returnees are greeted politely and placed carefully. Names are remembered even when details are not. The village assumes continuity until proven otherwise.

Common treatments include:
- Being offered the drink they used to order
- Being given the cut of meat they once preferred
- Being asked casually about someone who died while they were gone
- Having old routines resume slightly out of sync

No one asks what changed them. The town waits to see.

Stories about the outside world are listened to politely and repeated inaccurately.

---

## Contradictions That Persist
- The bell is wrong, but it can’t be proven.
- Aldric will return, but no one waits.
- Wildton doesn’t change, but it isn’t the same.

These contradictions are not resolved. They are maintained.

---

## Usage Notes (for AI)
- Use this lore to color dialogue, attitudes, and memory.
- Allow different NPCs to contradict one another without escalation.
- Do not introduce new locations, authorities, or structural rules here.
- Let repetition create familiarity, not closure.

## Open Lore Threads
(To be filled only if they emerge naturally)
- A seasonal custom no one remembers starting
- A saying whose meaning has drifted
- A minor disagreement everyone knows but no one settles
