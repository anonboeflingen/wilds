### The Ember Sanctum

Type: Location
Associated: Liora Emberflare
Tone: Radiant, austere, enduring, serene
Sensory Anchor: Warm air, scorched stone, faint salt, steady golden light

### Description

A hidden desert dwelling nestled within a crescent of volcanic rock, half-buried and nearly invisible unless sought with intention. It stands deep among ember-red dunes and crystalline glass ridges, shaped by heat, patience, and time.

The Sanctum feels less constructed than remembered, as if the desert itself allows it to persist.

### Notes

Entrance glows faintly at dawn and dusk, revealing narrow passages inward

Single central chamber lit by carved ceiling slits that scatter sunlight softly

A soundless golden brazier burns steadily at the center

Glass shards set into the floor trap and refract light like rippling water

### Usage Notes (for AI)

Used for reflection, endurance, quiet teaching, or recovery through stillness

Best surfaced in daylight, dawn, dusk, or under a clear night sky

The desert does not threaten here; it listens

The Sanctum remains calm regardless of emotional intensity
