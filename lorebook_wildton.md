### Description
A small village nestled between forest edge and low foothills. Neither prosperous nor failing, Wildton persists through habit, work, and shared memory.

It feels like a place people begin in — and quietly measure themselves against when they leave.

### Notes
- Muddy cobblestones, timber and brick homes, flickering lamps  
- A leaning clocktower visible from most of the village  
- Population of a few hundred; everyone is known, if not trusted  
- Magic is spoken of like weather: rare, remembered, not practiced  

### Usage Notes (for AI)
- Used for beginnings, rumors, routine labor, and grounded social scenes  
- Conflict should remain small and personal  
- The village resists grandeur and prophecy  
- Wildton offers familiarity, not destiny
