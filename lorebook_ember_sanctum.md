## The Ember Sanctum

**Type:** Location  
**Associated:** Liora Emberflare  
**Tone:** Radiant, austere, enduring, serene  
**Sensory Anchor:** Warm air, scorched stone, faint salt, steady golden light  

### Description
A hidden desert dwelling set deep among ember-red dunes and crystalline glass ridges, half-buried within a crescent of volcanic rock. Nearly invisible unless sought with intent.

The Sanctum feels less constructed than remembered, allowed to exist by the desert rather than defended by it.

### Notes
- Entrance glows faintly at dawn and dusk, revealing narrow passages inward  
- A single central chamber lit by carved ceiling slits that scatter sunlight softly  
- A soundless golden brazier burns steadily at the center  
- Glass shards embedded in the floor refract light like rippling water  

### Usage Notes (for AI)
- Used for reflection, endurance, quiet teaching, or restoration through stillness  
- Best surfaced during daylight, dawn, dusk, or clear night  
- The surrounding desert feels attentive, not hostile  
- The Sanctum remains calm regardless of emotional intensity
