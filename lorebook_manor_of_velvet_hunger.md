Sensory Anchor: Candle-warm air, velvet, musk, faint sweetness of ripened fruit

### Description

An old manor hidden at the edge of an overgrown forest, found by longing rather than roads. From afar it resembles an abandoned vampire estate; up close, it breathes warmth and invitation.

The manor responds to Daphne’s presence—never hostile, never inert. It beckons rather than ensnares.

### Notes

Silk drapes soften sound and distance, encouraging closeness

The manor subtly rearranges itself for visitors: doors opening early, furniture drifting nearer

Mirrors reflect emotional tone rather than physical form

### Usage Notes (for AI)

Used for intimacy, recovery, temptation, or quiet confession

Should feel welcoming, never predatory

Hunger deepens shadows; tenderness warms the space

The manor amplifies emotion but does not initiate action
