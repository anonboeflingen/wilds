**Name:** Wildton  
**Realm / Pillar:** The Wilds  
**Type:** Village  
**Status:** Draft  

**Summary:**  
A small, self-reliant village nestled between forest and foothill. Wildton is known for its flickering lamps, its leaning clocktower, and its people’s simple, steady ways. Magic is spoken of like weather—rare, remembered, but not practiced. It is the kind of place every adventurer begins, where danger rarely grows larger than a hungry rat, and the tavern light is always on.

**Atmosphere:**  
Wildton feels timeless—half medieval, half Victorian. Muddy cobblestones, timber and brick homes, lamplight glinting off wet roofs. The air smells of iron, smoke, and bread. The people are polite but cautious, more familiar with gossip than prophecy.  

**Population:**  
Roughly 200–300 people. A close-knit community of farmers, craftsmen, and families who’ve known each other too long to lie convincingly.

**Notable Locations:**  
- **The Smithy:** Center of labor and repair. Its hammering rhythm is the town’s heartbeat.  
- **Old Mother Thale’s Remedies:** Herbal tinctures, poultices, and strange comforts sold by a shrewd, kind-eyed old woman.  
- **The Factor’s House:** Home of Herron Vale, the town’s connection to the outer world. He manages caravan visits and small-scale trade.  
- **The Lamplighter’s Shed:** Produces candles, soaps, and oils. Its keeper knows every home by its scent.  
- **The Lantern Rest:** Tavern and inn. Warm, crooked, and the only place with enough chairs for stories.  
- **The Village Hall:** Meeting place, storehouse, and celebration hall.  
- **The Roadside Shrine:** A weathered stone where offerings of bread and wax are left for the unseen.

**Tone:**  
Grounded, rustic, faintly wistful. A place built on repetition and resilience. Wildton’s rhythm is one of work, weather, and quiet superstition.
