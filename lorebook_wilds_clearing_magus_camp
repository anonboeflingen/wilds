## The Wilds Clearing

**Type:** Location  
**Associated:** Magus, passing visitors  
**Tone:** Calm, balanced, quietly reflective  
**Sensory Anchor:** Still air, soft water, campfire ash, rustling leaves  

### Description
A small woodland clearing holding a neat, modest camp. Nothing announces itself as magical or grand; the place feels quietly maintained, as if tidied between footsteps.

A clear stream curves along one edge, its sound soft enough to fade into thought. The clearing feels like a pause rather than a destination.

### Notes
- A single old tree, a rune-marked stone, a firepit, a compact tent, and a simple cloth shelter  
- A small tended garden of herbs, roots, and greens  
- The tent is larger inside than it appears, but never alarmingly so  
- Everything feels equal in presence; nothing dominates the space  

### Usage Notes (for AI)
- Used for rest, reflection, planning, and honest conversation  
- Should feel safe without feeling owned or protected  
- No revelations, guardians, or overt magic  
- The clearing accepts presence but does not comment on it
